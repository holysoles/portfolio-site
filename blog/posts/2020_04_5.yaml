In the sneaker community it has become very commonplace to use \"bots\" to purchase the latest sneaker releases, since time and repetitive attempts are key to being able to get a pair. Back in high school had written a simple Javascript program to automate a few button clicks through a Chrome browser extension, but now that my coding experience and knowledge has increased, I thought I would take a crack at making a fully encapsulated desktop program."
  - text: "I chose to use Python as the primary language for this project as I haven't built a GUI before in Python and I thought that would be a good exercise. I was able to find the popular automated web testing framework [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). Selenium Webdriver gives the ability to control a browser window through code, such as window locations, button clicks, and more. It is a very straightforward package to install and use, as well as having a popular community with good resources. I built the GUI using elements from PyQt, a Python binding of the popular cross-platform toolkit Qt. This gave me easy access to pre-built elements like buttons, text field, and more, which I was able to access as objects through my code."

    list:
    - The list of URLs, sizes selected, and proxy info can be saved to a custom ".hcp" format file allowing for import and export.
    - Preview images of the selected sneaker.
    - Notification if a specified size is out of stock.
    - Circumvention of basic automated access detection.
    - An API call to my webserver to run a check on a verification code to use the program.
    - Proxy support, as IP based bans are possible if a website is able to detect you are using a bot.
    - Implementation of multi-threading in order to allow multiple bot instances to run at once.
    - Threads are able to be terminated by the user using flags between functions.
    - Any cart instance is able to be open and checked out by the user through transferring cookies between browser sessions.

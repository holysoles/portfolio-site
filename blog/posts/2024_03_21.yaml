  - section_title: "Overview"
    text: "I wanted to share my recent journey of containerizing two of my projects, a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) 
      app ([this website](https://github.com/holysoles/portfolio-site)) and a Go web app ([ginrcon](https://github.com/holysoles/ginrcon)), 
      and then building a CI/CD pipeline to automate building and publishing the Docker image. Let's dive in!"
  - section_title: "The Motivation Behind Containerization"
    text: "As the deployment complexity of my projects grew, I found managing VMs, dependencies, scaling, and patching to be increasingly 
      challenging. I've been consuming and deploying Docker containers for awhile for various services at home, such as Pi-hole, a [Unifi network server](https://help.ui.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012282453-Self-Hosting-a-UniFi-Network-Server), 
      a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) stack, and more. I've seen the advantages of containers as an administrator, so from the development perspective, I knew 
      containers promised consistency across different environments, simplified deployments, and enhanced scalability."
  - section_title: "Flask App Containerization"
    text: "I started by creating a Dockerfile for my Flask app. This involved specifying a base image, copying my app's code into the 
      container, installing dependencies, and exposing the necessary ports. Since I had already written a Linux service unit file, I stuck 
      with running the Flask app with [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/)."
  - text: "To ensure the web app would also run highly-available, I planned on deploying it in a replicated fashion, so I utilized Docker 
      Compose for my Swarm. This allowed me to define the replication definition in a simple YAML file, alongside the image spec."
  - section_title: "Go App Containerization"
    text: "One of the perks of Go is its ability to compile to a single binary. Leveraging this, I created a Dockerfile for my Go app, 
      ensuring it downloaded dependencies and compiled within the build container, on a pinned Go version, for consistency."
  - text: "Since Go compiles to a binary, my Dockerfile for the Go app focused on creating a minimalistic image, resulting in faster 
      builds and smaller image sizes. This is why I chose to use Alpine Linux as the final image. This lead to me using a multi-staged 
      build to accomplish all intended goals."
  - section_title: "CI Pipeline"
    text: "After determining the needed image build and publishing workflows to ensure my image was available on the GitHub Container
      Repository (GHCR), I figured setting up a CI pipeline to handle those steps for me automatically would further contribute to a 
      consistent image, in addition to being easier to manage. While I have much experience with GitLab CI professionally, 
      these projects were both already hosted on GitHub, so I chose to learn how to use GitHub Actions to run these pipelines."
  - text: "Leveraging GitHub Actions' flexibility, I wrote a workflow to build Docker images that works for both apps, triggered by
      Releases on the project. Once the image is built successfully, another step in the workflow pushes these images to the associated 
      package repo (GHCR), with the version auto-detected based on the Release version."
  - section_title: "Conclusion"
    text: "The migration of my Flask and Go web apps into containers, coupled with the establishment of a Docker image build and publish 
      pipeline, has improved my development and deployment workflows. Containerization has not only enhanced portability, scalability,
      and availability, but also simplified the management of dependencies. With a reliable CI/CD pipeline in place, I'm better equipped 
      to iterate on my projects in the future."
  - text: "For future improvements, I'd like to work on developing unit tests for these projects as well as create GitHub Actions to trigger them automatically upon new commits/PRs."
